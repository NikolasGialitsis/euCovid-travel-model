Stefan suggested the following strategy (which became obsolete for me,
when CModelExpansion was exposed in the bindings)

0 save reactions reactions

1 copy compartment:
  model.getCompartments.addCopy(source)

2 rename compartment
  model.getCompartments[source.ObjectName + "_1"]

3 for each save reaction as r
  1 copy reaction
    model.getReactions.addCopy(r)
  2 R = model.getReactions.[r + "_1")
  3 Rename R to ...
  4 scheme = r.getReactionScheme
  5 replace source.ObjectName with compartment.ObjectName in scheme
  6 R.setReactionScheme(scheme)

repeat 1-3 as needed.
